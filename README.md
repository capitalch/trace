I have undertaken the work of creating a complete accounting software in PostgreSql, React and Python. Its a herculian task, I know. I am not sure if I will be able to complete it. But I have started the work and everything I am uploading to GitHub.

I have selected Python with Flask as web server. I tested Flask in cloud. It worked fine. Advantage of Python is I will be able to use Machine Learning algorithms and data science with my accounting system. I am providing me experience in the file Lessons Learned
