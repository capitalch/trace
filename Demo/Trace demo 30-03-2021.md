Trace: Basic functionality of financial accounting completed so far.

1. Multi platform, cloud based, Multi tenant, multi locations, multi godown, multi branches with security and compliances in place. I tested it working fine on Linux. It works in browser and after doing compilation in Electron it also worked as stand alone native application.

2. Technology: Keeping in view of Speed, large data handling with usage of machine learning and AI algorithms. I carefully selected React, TypeScript, Python, GraphQL, Flask web server, PostgreSql, Docker, Pandas. Hosted on cloud. Repository: GitHub

3. Advantage: Speed. Looks like local native app. Does not give feeling like working on web pages wherein url changes for every page. Have not seen such type of application in market place so far.
